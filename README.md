*Introduction*
The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator is a simple yet effective tool designed to help users determine their BMI based on their weight and height. BMI is an important health indicator that helps in assessing whether an individual is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

*Project Overview*
This project provides a Python-based BMI Calculator with a user-friendly command-line interface. The calculator prompts users to input their weight and height, calculates the BMI, and categorizes the result into various weight categories. The project is designed to be easily extendable and customizable.

*Features*
Input Validation: Ensures that the user inputs valid numerical data for weight and height.
BMI Calculation: Uses the standard BMI formula to calculate the BMI.
Categorization: Classifies the calculated BMI into standard weight categories.
Unit Tests: Includes comprehensive tests to validate the functionality and accuracy of the calculator.

Installation
To set up the BMI Calculator on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BMI-Calculator.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd BMI-Calculator
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the BMI Calculator, follow these steps:

Run the BMI calculator script:
python src/bmi_calculator.py
Enter your weight and height when prompted:
The calculator will prompt you to input your weight in kilograms and height in meters.
View your BMI and category:
The calculator will display your calculated BMI and categorize it into underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity.
Explanation of BMI
BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. The formula for BMI is:
BMI
=
weight (kg)
height (m)
2
BMI= 
height (m) 
2
 
weight (kg)
​
 

BMI Categories
Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9
Obesity: BMI ≥ 30
Detailed Features
Input Validation
The BMI Calculator ensures that users enter valid numerical values for weight and height. It handles common input errors and prompts the user to enter correct values if invalid data is detected.

BMI Calculation
The BMI is calculated using the standard formula. The result is rounded to two decimal places for clarity.

Categorization
Based on the calculated BMI, the result is categorized into one of four standard weight categories. This helps users understand their BMI in a meaningful context.

Unit Tests
The project includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the BMI calculations and categorization. These tests are located in the tests/ directory and cover various edge cases and typical scenarios.

Testing
To run the unit tests for the BMI Calculator, use the following command:
python -m unittest discover -s tests
The tests will run automatically and provide feedback on the functionality and accuracy of the BMI calculator.

Future Enhancements
The BMI Calculator project can be extended with the following features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt for a more user-friendly experience.
Advanced Metrics: Include additional health metrics such as Body Fat Percentage, Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and Waist-to-Height Ratio.
Mobile App: Create a mobile application for Android and iOS platforms to reach a wider audience.
Multilingual Support: Add support for multiple languages to cater to non-English speaking users.
